## xmmx_bridge | Update - v2.1
### Changed:
- Fixed typo with codem-inventory. If you were having issues, this is now resolved.
- Added support for tgiann-inventory.

### Note:
Please keep in mind the bridge is what controls all script functions. This is where you will integrate
your own resources (inventory, target, textui, notifications, progressbar, etc.) if not already available.
