# XMMX BRIDGE RESOURCE v2.6

**Update v2.4 -> v2.6 - 11/11/2025:**
```
• Removed the zoom functionality as it was optional and when setting enableZoom to false was causing an error in the script.
• Moved qbx_core to be checked before qb-core since qbx_core provides qb-core and would cause the bridge to think qb-core was started on qbx.
• Reverted some variables back to the old way as requested by many.
• Other minor code cleanup.
```
