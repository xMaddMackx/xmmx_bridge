# XMMX BRIDGE RESOURCE v2.4

**Update v2.3 -> v2.4 - 10/14/2025:**
```
• Fixed typo in shared/cache.lua.
• Changed resource check at the top of each client/inventory file to independently check the resource state.
• Fixed framework check in server/functions.lua and shared/cache.lua.
```
*If having issues, delete any files not relevant to your inventory or framework! This will resolve a lot of issues for those having errors! In particular, the `GetItemLabel` error.*
