# XMMX BRIDGE RESOURCE

**Update v2.2 - 10/11/2025:**
```
• Fixed typo in fxmanifest which caused editable files to be escrowed.
• Fixed item exploit in editable/consumables.lua.
• Reorganized cache.lua, in particular detect qbx before qb, and ak47_qb_inventory before ak47_inventory.
```
*Please keep in mind, you can delete the files that you don't use if they're conflicting. This tends to be
the case in AK Inventories due to the fxmanifest.lua providing qb-inventory and both his inventories.*
